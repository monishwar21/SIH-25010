## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Project Name: AI-Powered Personalized Farming Companion</h3>
1)Hybrid Data Integration for Precision Advisory:
Combines satellite imagery, IoT soil sensors (deployed via local cooperatives), and farmer input to generate precise soil health and crop recommendations.
Uses AI to analyze historical crop data, weather forecasts, and pest/disease patterns for predictive insights.

2)Multilingual Voice-First Interface with Local Dialect Support:
Supports 10+ Indian languages and dialects with natural language processing (NLP) tuned to local accents.
Voice commands and responses enable farmers with low literacy to interact seamlessly.
Offline voice recognition and response capabilities for areas with poor connectivity.

3)Community Knowledge Network:
Farmers can share localized tips, pest alerts, and success stories via voice notes or text.
AI curates and validates community inputs to enrich advisory content.
Builds trust and reduces dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

4)Image-Based Pest and Disease Diagnosis:
Farmers upload photos of crops via the app or WhatsApp integration.
AI-powered image recognition identifies pests/diseases and suggests eco-friendly treatment options.

5)Dynamic Market Price and Supply Chain Insights:
Real-time tracking of local market prices for crops.
Alerts on best selling times and nearby buyers to maximize farmer income.

6)Sustainability Score and Gamification:
Provides a “Sustainability Score” based on input usage, crop rotation, and soil health.
Gamifies sustainable practices with rewards and recognition to encourage adoption.

7)Offline Mode with SMS/USSD Integration:
Core advisory and alerts available via SMS or USSD for farmers without smartphones.
Ensures maximum reach and usability.


## Technical Approach
1)AI/ML models for soil, pest, and weather analytics.
2)NLP and speech recognition tuned for Indian languages.
3)Satellite data APIs (e.g., ISRO’s Bhuvan platform).
4)IoT soil sensors with LoRaWAN connectivity.
5)Mobile app (Android/iOS) + SMS/USSD backend.
6)Cloud infrastructure with edge computing for offline support.

## Feasibility and Viability
1)Technical Feasibility: Proven AI/ML for crop & pest analysis, affordable IoT sensors, ISRO/IMD satellite APIs, multilingual NLP, and SMS/USSD offline support make deployment practical.
2)Operational Feasibility: Farmer cooperatives, NGOs, and govt schemes can support sensor deployment, training, and outreach.
Financial Feasibility: Costs manageable through govt/CSR support, freemium model, and agri-business partnerships.
3)Economic Viability: Farmers can increase income by 15–20% and reduce chemical costs by ~30%. Revenue streams via subscriptions, B2B tie-ups, and govt programs.
Social Viability: Voice-first, multilingual, community-driven approach ensures inclusivity and builds trust.
4)Environmental Viability: Promotes sustainable practices with eco-advisory and gamified rewards.

## Impact and Benefits
1.Yields up by 25–35%.
 Farmer incomes up by 15–20%.
 2.Reduced chemical overuse (30%), healthier soil & environment.
 3.Empower 10M+ small farmers in 3 years.
4.Improved digital literacy & rural community engagement.
